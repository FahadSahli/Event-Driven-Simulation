# Event-Driven-Simulation
This is an event-driven simulation of mapping and scheduling of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). The code implements Greedy Best Availability (GBA) algorithm develped by Mijumbi et al. on their work "Design and Evaluation of Algorithms for Mapping
and Scheduling of Virtual Network Functions". The paper could found at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7116120.
